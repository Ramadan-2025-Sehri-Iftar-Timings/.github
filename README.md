## **Ramadan 2025 Calendar: Key Dates and Significance**

The **Ramadan 2025 calendar** holds immense importance for Muslims, as it dictates the period of fasting (*sawm*), one of Islam’s Five Pillars. In Pakistan, the Central Ruet-e-Hilal Committee will announce the official start date after moon sightings, but astronomical projections suggest Ramadan 1446 AH will likely span **March 1–March 30, 2025**. The month culminates in Eid al-Fitr, a celebration marked by communal prayers and feasting.

Fasting during Ramadan involves abstaining from food, drink, and other physical needs from dawn (*Fajr*) until sunset (*Maghrib*). Two critical daily rituals are:

1. **Sehri**: The pre-dawn meal consumed before fasting begins.
2. **Iftar**: The meal to break the fast at sunset.

These timings vary daily and by location due to changing sunrise/sunset times. Below, we explore the **Ramadan 2025 timetable** for Pakistan, with a focus on Lahore and Karachi.


## **Understanding Sehri and Iftar: Spiritual and Practical Aspects**

**Sehri** and **Iftar** are more than meals; they are acts of worship. Sehri is eaten in the quiet, early hours, symbolizing discipline and intention. Iftar, often shared with family or community, embodies gratitude and generosity.

In 2025, the **Ramadan Sehri and Iftar time** will follow local sunrise and sunset. For accuracy, many Muslims rely on mosque announcements or apps like **IslamicFinder**, which calculate prayer times based on geographic coordinates. Let’s delve into the **Ramadan schedule 2025** for Pakistan.


## **Ramadan 2025 Timetable in Pakistan**

Pakistan’s diverse geography means Sehri/Iftar times differ slightly between cities. Generally, fasting lasts 13–15 hours in early March, gradually increasing as days lengthen. Below is a *sample* **Ramadan 2025 timetable** for mid-March (actual times may vary):

| Date       | Sehri (Approx.) | Iftar (Approx.) | Fasting Duration |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| March 10   | 5:00 AM         | 6:15 PM         | 13h 15m           |
| March 20   | 4:50 AM         | 6:25 PM         | 13h 35m           |
| March 30   | 4:40 AM         | 6:35 PM         | 13h 55m           |
